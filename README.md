# TOPAS Gantry
Compute the dose in human phantom using the CPO universal nozzle geometry. The main file is generated with the Viewer visualization tool (https://github.com/PierreLansonneur/Viewer). This code is developed for protontherapy (pencil beam scanning) and is based on TOPAS 3.2 (see http://www.topasmc.org/).
